Hi! I am Francis Quina. I am currently doing my English PhD at the University of Pittsburgh, in the Literature program's [Media and Material Practices](https://www.literature.pitt.edu/graduate/focal-areas/media-and-material-practices) area. My research at Pitt focuses on the intersections of game studies, material culture, in particular the cultural study of collectible card games.

Before coming to Pitt, I taught creative writing and literature courses at the [University of the Philippines](https://decl.kal.upd.edu.ph/faculty/creative-writing), where I am currently a faculty-on-leave.
